# ChimeraOS
ChimeraOS is the open-source operating system built by Blue Moon Enterprises. Currently, it's a prototype that runs on Windows, but soon, it'll be a custom version of Linux, with its own unique appearance and software.

## The current prototype
The current version of ChimeraOS is programmed using Visual Studio, and runs as a Windows app. It gives an idea of some of the design principles we will implement into the real ChimeraOS, but cannot be run as an operating system. The code for the current version will be in this repository soon.

## The Linux version
ChimeraOS will eventually become a Linux operating system, with two versions - ChimeraOS Box and ChimeraOS Desk. Box will be a games-focused operating system, with an interface that is easy to navigate with a controller. Box will also include an easy way to install games and other software, the Chimera Store. Desk, however, will be a more desktop-focused operating system, with lots of software to stay productive and work easily. It will also include the Chimera Store, but with more of a focus on desktop applications. Of course, both versions of ChimeraOS will be able to run on other hardware as well as our own - all Blue Moon software is licensed under the [MIT Licence](LICENSE).
